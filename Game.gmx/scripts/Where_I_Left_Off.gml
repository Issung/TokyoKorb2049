//Was going to create sounds, some for collecting points. (want a touhou like sound for picking up P)
//and was going to make multiple meow sounds for when hitting the enemy cats.
//Need to start programming different cat behaviours and creating different cat sprites (different breeds, colours, etc.
//Need to think of a legit tutorial instead of using the dumb one i thought of. (make a auto learning tutorial)

//____________22 April 9:32.PM Nan's (Terri's) House_____________
//Was making tutorialController  version 2, a version which uses no text to teach the player how to play, but 
//uses finger icons and highlighting to teach the player how to control the game.
//Need to make new sounds (need one for collecting points) and when I get home start thinking about music, -
//(Blank Banshee, Hotline Miami OST, Macintosh Plus, TEAC, Party Hard OST) (REMIND ME TO CHECK OUT THAT GAME I INBOXED TO DANYAL BRIDGE)
//This is my last night at nan and pop's. I like it here, remind me to come back up to see them again before it's too late.
